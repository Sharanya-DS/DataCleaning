The variables used in the code/ text file are given below. 
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
•	tBodyAcc-XYZ
•	tGravityAcc-XYZ
•	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
•	tBodyGyro-XYZ
•	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
•	tBodyAccMag
•	tGravityAccMag
•	tBodyAccJerkMag
•	tBodyGyroMag
•	tBodyGyroJerkMag
•	fBodyAcc-XYZ
•	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
•	fBodyGyro-XYZ
•	fBodyAccMag
•	fBodyAccJerkMag
•	fBodyGyroMag
•	fBodyGyroJerkMag
The set of variables that were calculated from these given values are:
•	mean(): Mean value
•	std(): Standard deviation
Additional variables created are:
•	gravityMean
•	tBodyAccMean
•	tBodyAccJerkMean
•	tBodyGyroMean
•	tBodyGyroJerkMean

Other estimates have been removed for the purpose of this excercise.
